# Chapter 7: Android Camera Calibration and AR using the ARUco Module

One of the most sought after application for mobile computer vision is augmented reality (AR). 
Blending real and virtual worlds has applications in entertainment and gaming, medical and healthcare, industry and defense, and many more. 
In this chapter we will learn how to implement an AR application from scratch in the Android ecosystem, by using OpenCV's ARUco contrib module, Android's Camera2 APIs as well as the JMonkeyEngine 3D game engine. 
However first we will begin with simply calibrating our Android device's camera using ARUco's ChArUco calibration board, which provides a more robust alternative to OpenCV's calib3d chessboards.

## Requirements
* OpenCV v3 or v4 Android SDK compiled with ArUco contrib module: https://github.com/Mainvooid/opencv-android-sdk-with-contrib
* Android Studio v3.2+
* Android device running Android OS v6.0+
