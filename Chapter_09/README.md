# Chapter 9: Finding the Best OpenCV Algorithm for the Job

Working with OpenCV, a computer vision engineer has many algorithmic options on hand to solve a given task. 
Making the right choice in an informed way is extremely important since it can have tremendous impact on the success of the entire solution, and prevent from boxing into a rigid implementation. 
This chapter will discuss some methods to follow when considering options within OpenCV. 
We will discuss the areas in computer vision that OpenCV covers, ways to select between competing algorithms if more than one exists, how to measure the success of an algorithm, and finally how to measure success in a robust way with a pipeline.
